*Predicition of Laminate Failure using Classical Laminate Theory (CLT)*


The Tsai-Hill criterion is a quadratic, interactive stress-based criterion that identifies failure, but does not distinguish between different modes of failure.

Failure occurs whenever the following condition is satisfied.

The coefficients Sij of the Tsai-Hill criterion are computed as follows:

S<sub>11</sub><sup>+</sup> = Value of σ<sub>11</sub> at longitudinal tensile failure

S<sub>11</sub><sup>-</sup> = Value of σ<sub>11</sub> at longitudinal compressive failure

S<sub>22</sub><sup>+</sup> = Value of σ<sub>22</sub> at transverse tensile failure

S<sub>22</sub><sup>-</sup> = Value of σ<sub>22</sub> at transverse compressive failure

S<sub>12</sub> = Absolute value of σ<sub>12</sub> at longitudinal shear failure
